# sol-solver
Example of using torchtext using language model on a dataset with an mlflow backend. Model is just a dummy and isn't highly performant. Built off of data compiled for DeepSol: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29554211/ which performs much better than this example which may in fact not be learning anything :).
