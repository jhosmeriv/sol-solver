# sol-solver
Example of using torchtext using language model on a dataset with an mlflow backend. Model is just a dummy and isn't highly performant. Built off of data compiled for [DeepSol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29554211/) which performs much better than this example which may in fact not be learning anything :).

Directions for use: 
1) [Download deepsol data](https://zenodo.org/record/1162886/files/sameerkhurana10/DSOL_rv0.2-v0.3.zip?download=1) to project root
2) Run python deepsol_transform.py
3) Use deepsol.ipynb notebook to play with demo
